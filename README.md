# go-domain-driven-design
A demo project to illustrate DDD (Domain Driven Design) and DI (Dependency Injection) in Go Language.

#### What is Domain-Driven Design?
Initially introduced and made popular by programmer Eric Evans in his 2004 book, Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software, domain-driven design is the expansion upon and application of the domainconcept, as it applies to the development of software. It aims to ease the creation of complex applications by connecting the related pieces of the software into an ever-evolving model.

#### What is Dependency Injection?
Dependency Injection (DI) is the process of supplying a resource that a given piece of code requires. The required resource, which is often a component of the application itself, is called a dependency.
